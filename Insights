🚀 Pizza Hut Production Analysis: Optimizing Manpower, Inventory, and Feasibility 🍕📊

I recently conducted a data-driven analysis of Pizza Hut’s production data to help optimize manpower planning, inventory management, and overall feasibility. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I processed and analyzed key production trends to provide actionable insights for efficient operations.

🔧 Tech Stack Used:
 ✅ Excel – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and structuring
 ✅ SQL – Data manipulation, joins, and aggregations
 ✅ Power BI – Interactive dashboards for deeper insights

📊 Power BI Dashboards:
1️⃣ Dashboard 1: Displays month-wise total pizzas prepared, with a legend for time shifts. Interactive slicers for day of the week and time shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night), Pizza Categories allows users to extract deep insights.
2️⃣ Dashboard 2: Provides a detailed breakdown of pizza production across month, day of the week, category, size, time shifts, and ranking of Pizza categories, Interactive slicers for month and time enhance usability.

🔍 Key Insights:
 📌 Total Orders Processed: 48.62K | Total Pizzas Prepared: 50K
 📌 Peak Production Months: July (8.86%), May (8.73%), and March (8.60%)
 📌 High-Demand Days: Friday (16.63%), Saturday (15.11%), and Thursday (15.08%)
 📌 Time Slot Analysis:
 Evening Shift Dominates: 46.01% of total production
 Afternoon Shift: 40.38%, indicating consistent demand
 📌 Pizza Category Distribution:
