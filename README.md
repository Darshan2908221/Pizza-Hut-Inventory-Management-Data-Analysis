🚀 Pizza Hut Production Analysis: Optimizing Manpower, Inventory, and Feasibility 🍕📊
<br>
<br>
I recently conducted a data-driven analysis of Pizza Hut’s production data to help optimize manpower planning, inventory management, and overall feasibility. Using 
<br>
Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I processed and analyzed key production trends to provide actionable insights for efficient operations.
<br>
<br>
🔧 Tech Stack Used:
<br>
 ✅ Excel – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and structuring
 <br>
 ✅ SQL – Data manipulation, joins, and aggregations
 <br>
 ✅ Power BI – Interactive dashboards for deeper insights
<br>
<br>
📊 Power BI Dashboards:
<br>
1️⃣ Dashboard 1: Displays month-wise total pizzas prepared, with a legend for time shifts. Interactive slicers for day of the week and time shifts (Morning, 
<br>
Afternoon, Evening, Night), Pizza Categories allows users to extract deep insights.
<br>
2️⃣ Dashboard 2: Provides a detailed breakdown of pizza production across month, day of the week, category, size, time shifts, and ranking of Pizza categories, 
<br>
Interactive slicers for month and time enhance usability.
<br>
